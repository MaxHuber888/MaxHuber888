## Hi, my name is Max
I am an AI/ML engineer focused on building systems with clear real-world impact. My work is guided by a simple principle: effective AI should make people's lives tangibly better.

### Currently I am:
- completing M.S. in AI @ NEU
- researching network theoretic approaches for modeling muscle synergies to improve stroke recovery outcomes
- looking for work in AI/ML, data science/eng, and computer vision
